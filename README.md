# CapsuleVAE

**CapsuleVAE** is an experimental architecture that aims to improve the disentanglement of latent variables in variational autoencoders with the help of [capsule networks](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/file/2cad8fa47bbef282badbb8de5374b894-Paper.pdf), proposed by Hinton et al.

The evaluation metrics are from **disentanglement_lib** repo, an open-source library for research on learning disentangled representation. by Google.
